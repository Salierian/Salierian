## Keeping track
`
For starters, I intend to keep track of my progress as a programmer over the course of, at the very least a year.
So the purpose of this account is to help me keep track of contributions in that timespan.
`

`The plan is to make a contribution every day, no matter how small it is. No matter how big it is. The only goal is adding something every day.`
